Hello World!

Hopefully, I can publish and document stuff that I had trouble finding myself. So this blog will really be a collation of the answers I once had and had trouble finding in the hope that those later wont have to suffer as I have.

Also its gonna be a place for me to ramble, e.g. why is it so flipping hard to set up a blog. I had a prof that made us use tumblr, and now I understand why. Setting up your own website sucks.
