  If anyone is hiring an electrical engineer in Australia, please let me know.
</p>

<p>The most fustrating thing I found during my time studying a Bachelors &amp; Master of Electrical Engineering is that professors made everything much harder than it needed to be. Understanding concepts took more and more time, and there were very select individuals who were able to explain things clearly. This blog hopefully changes that, by getting rid of the formality and maths in  engineering, and striving for resources and intuition first in explanations.</p>

<p>I aim to write about things that werent easy to find. So hopefully noone will have to suffer like I have. The fields Iâ€™ll probably cover (interest areas) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DSP</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Data science</li>
  <li>Religon and Theology</li>
</ul>
